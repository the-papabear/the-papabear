const gabriel: WebDeveloper = {
  location: 'Iasi, Romania',
  company: 'Thinslices',
  
  tools:  {
            testing:  ['Cypress', 'Jest', 'Apollo Sandbox', 'React Testing Library'],
            backend:  ['Node.js', 'REST APIs', 'GraphQL/Apollo Server', 'Neo4j/Cypher', 'MongoDB', 'PostgreSQL(SQL and knex.js query builder)'],

  motivation: `I remember the excitement of "Hello World" popping up on my screen,
               and that thrill has been my driving force ever since. I've jumped
               headfirst into countless projects and discoveries in this amazing field.
               My mission? Keep learning, keep building cool stuff,
               and keep that warm, fuzzy feeling going every day.
               If I can share some of that good vibe with others, all the better!`
